# k-component
a simple component shim, using custom element

## about custom-element-shim
Yes, it support IE8! But using IE8 means loading more files and trick coding.  
I just leave it [here](demo/IE8.html).

## about shadowDOM shim
shadowDOM is only for CHROME, so many browsers do not support it.  
So I've decided to use fake shadow root to do the work, and use template engine to do rendering work.  
the template engine currently is [etpl](https://github.com/ecomfe/etpl)

## about import
like shadowDOM, I've decided using AMD Loader to import component.  
like this:
```javascript
require('k-component/component!somepath/something');
// with this we don't need to do anything else
```
./somepath/something.component.html will be loaded as a html. You can register a component inside it.  

or like this
```javascript
require('component/somePath/AComponent');
// you should have the code below in component/somePath/AComponent.js
require('k-component/component!./aComponent');
```

Just call it `component.html`

## register Element
using HTML inside `component.html`
```html
<k-component name="hello-world">
    <template>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <div>
            This is <content></content> saying HELLO.
        </div>
    </template>
</k-component>
```

>register first, then put it in DOM TREE

```html
<!-- another template -->
<hello-world>Leo Wang</hello-world>
```
the result html is:
```html
<hello-world>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <div>
        This is <content>Leo Wang</content> saying HELLO.
    </div>
</hello-world>
```
YES, using content tag to import inside HTML.
